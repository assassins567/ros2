[2.706s]   By not providing "Findsensor_msg.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project

[2.707s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "sensor_msg" with

[2.708s]   Add the installation prefix of "sensor_msg" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
[2.708s]   "sensor_msg_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
